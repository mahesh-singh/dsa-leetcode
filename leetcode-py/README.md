# Python cheat sheets


`words: List[str]` create a map store graph as an adjacency list where chars become the the key and value becomes adjacency list/array 
 `graph = {char: [] for word in words for char in word}`
 this will create following map
 
 `input = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]`
 output `{'w': [], 'r': [], 't': [], 'f': [], 'e': []}`
